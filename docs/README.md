### [Day 1 - Introduction to Programming](./Intro/main.md)
We begin with a gentle introduction to programming in Python, one of the most popular and favoured languages for beginners. For Python experts, we have additional challenges to test your abilities to the extreme.

### [Day 2 - Introduction to Game Development](./gameDev)
We then venture into the world of gaming with Javascript, opening up avenues to create anything your mind can imagine. What awaits is for you to discover the endless possibilities of the technology that will shape our future.

### [Day 3 - Introduction to Arduino and Hardware](./arduino.md)
Today we make a jump from the everyday gadgets of phones and gaming consoles, to leap into the world of a tiny computer known as the Arduino. We will build our very own devices with lights, sensors and more.

### [Day 4 - Introduction to Virtual Reality](./vr)
You will learn how to use A-frame, a web-based framework through which you will be able to create your own virtual reality experiences. You will be able to personally experience this with the assistance of Google Cardboard.

### [Day 5 - Introduction to Security](./security.md)
The first thing that may come to mind when you hear ‘cybersecurity’ is an image of a hooded figure clacking away at a keyboard in a dark room. But today, we will challenge this idea by showing you the reality of cybersecurity; all the necessary tools of the trade, and its juicy secrets.
