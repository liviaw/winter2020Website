# Summer Space Academy
This repo contains the Github Pages hosted help site

Access here: [summer2020.compclub.com.au](//summer2020.compclub.com.au)

## Editing

Edit the markdown files in the `/docs/` folder to change the site. The site is rebuilt on commit.

If you want to add a new page (say for your day), just create the markdown file (eg day2.md) and link to it from the homepage.

If you want to write up content and then publish it later just leave it in the `/drafts/` folder and then move it on the day.

Please feel free to make any and all changes you want :turtle:
